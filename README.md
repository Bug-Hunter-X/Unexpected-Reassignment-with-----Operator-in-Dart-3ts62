# Unexpected Reassignment with ??= Operator in Dart

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior with the null-aware assignment operator (`??=`) in Dart.  The issue arises when using `??=` within a method, where subsequent calls to the method might unexpectedly reassign a variable that was initially assigned using `??=`. 

## Problem Description
The `??=` operator is designed to assign a value only if the variable is currently null. However, in this case, after an initial assignment via `??=`, a subsequent call to the same method can still trigger the assignment, overriding the previously set value. This is counter-intuitive and can lead to unexpected behavior in applications.

## Code Example
The `bug.dart` file contains a minimal, reproducible example. The solution that fixes the issue is described in `bugSolution.dart`.

## Solution
The solution involves using a different approach to handle potential null values. Instead of relying on `??=` for assigning a default value within a method, maintain explicit control over the variable's state.
